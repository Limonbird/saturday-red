              <p>
                Cookies are small text files created by a website and downloaded to your device when you access a
                website. These cookies are sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to any
                other website that recognizes the cookie. Cookies are useful because they help a website recognize a
                visitor's device.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies perform many different tasks. The most common use is to provide login information for a user on
                a particular site, such as username and password, after the user clicks "Remember me on this computer,"
                which creates a login cookie. Some cookies are used by e-commerce sites to store items placed in a
                shopping cart. Other cookies help you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences and
                search settings, and generally improve your user experience. Many cookies collect information about how
                visitors use a website, such as which pages visitors visit most frequently. They also help ensure that
                online ads are more relevant to a website visitor.

              require all users to be 21 years of age or older to access our platform. In addition to age restrictions,
              we advocate for responsible gaming practices. Gambling should be a form of entertainment, not a means to
              financial instability or emotional distress. Please gamble responsibly and set limits on both your time
              and spending. If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction or related issues, we urge
              you to seek help from professional resources such as gambling addiction helplines or support groups.
              Remember, there's no shame in asking for assistance when it's needed. By using our platform, you agree to
              abide by these guidelines and take responsibility for your gaming behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be careful, because gambling can lead to EXCESSIVE or PATHOLOGIC gambling behavior. Play responsibly and
              in moderation! Gambling and betting are PROHIBITED for minors! 21+
