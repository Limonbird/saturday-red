              We want your gaming experience to be not only enjoyable but also safe and responsible. Therefore, we
              require all users to be 21 years of age or older to access our platform. In addition to age restrictions,
              we advocate for responsible gaming practices. Gambling should be a form of entertainment, not a means to
              financial instability or emotional distress. Please gamble responsibly and set limits on both your time
              and spending. If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction or related issues, we urge
              you to seek help from professional resources such as gambling addiction helplines or support groups.
              Remember, there's no shame in asking for assistance when it's needed. By using our platform, you agree to
              abide by these guidelines and take responsibility for your gaming behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be careful, because gambling can lead to EXCESSIVE or PATHOLOGIC gambling behavior. Play responsibly and
              in moderation! Gambling and betting are PROHIBITED for minors! 21+
